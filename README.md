Module 3 Project

Miga Web


## Structure

This MERN project has two folders, one for the back and one for the frontend

### Backend

Two models, routes and controllers <br>
Users: So users can register<br>
Products: Where we can see and list all the products from the DB<br>
The DB of products has been manually created with a JSON cause there is no api that provides the especific info we need

### Frontend

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
